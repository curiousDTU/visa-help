    <p>Take my advice, just make cheap hostel bookings across the country that you can easily cancel after getting your visa: they can’t question the bookings and it is the simplest and easiest way to keep the paper work light. (And stick to your story during the interview).</p>

  	<p>When we looked through his visa supporting documents, we noticed that the tickets were booked for 6 nights, but the hotel was reserved for 7 nights. Though it may seem to be a simple mistake, but it is  not acceptable.</p>

  	<p>What is a Schengen Visa?</p>
  	<p>The Schengen visa is a 90-day tourist visa for Schengen zone countries that include Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.</p>
  	<p>The zone up to 90 days within a 180 day period. These days don’t need to be consecutive. This means that you can leave the zone to go to other neighboring countries and then come back again and the counting continues. The total is cumulative. Once Day 181 hits, the count resets itself.</p>
  	<p>When can I apply?</p>
  	<p>You can apply as early as 3 months before your expected departure date. For example: if you want to fly to Europe on June 30, you can apply as early as March 30. If you are super sure that you are going, I suggest you apply the earliest possible time because (1) there are many people who are applying for visas and you might not get your desired interview appointment date and (2) you can then book a cheaper roundtrip flight once your visa is approved versus applying last minute and, consequently, booking your flight last minute which makes it astronomically expensive.</p>
  	<p>Purpose of travel</p>
  	<p>For those visiting for tourism, you need to submit your itinerary and reservation of a roundtrip ticket and confirmation of hotel/guest house that the accommodation has already been paid for.</p>
  	<p>Note that the round trip ticket should just be a reservation and not confirmed tickets! You can get this flight itinerary from any travel agency. Some charge money for it. Others are free.</p>
  	<p>As for the hotel confirmation, you’ll have to prebook them. Save your sanity and money by choosing those that you can cancel and those that only charge you once you’ve checked-in. Remember you still don’t have the visa.</p>
  	<p>For the proof of relationship, you can use birth or marriage certificates, written correspondence between you and your sponsor, proof of telephone connections and other evidence of relationship between you and your sponsor.</p>
  	<p>I submitted an invitation letter even though I have a Formal Obligation. I printed email conversations and our flight bookings when we traveled together in Europe which shows that I really know this person.I also submitted a copy of my friend’s passport and Philippine stamps when he visited me in the Philippines. The interviewer even asked for photos but I thought you can’t show photos as evidence but apparently you can. So bring those photo albums!</p>
  	<p>The informal invitation is just a letter written and signed by your host/sponsor. There’s no specific format for this but I think it should state that he/she is inviting you, how you know each other, how long you are visiting and where you will be staying (their address).</p>
  	<p>Financial Capability:</p>
  	<p>Regardless if you’re visiting for tourism or visiting family/friends, you can prove your financial capability by submitting any of the three:

  	<list>
  		<item>
  			<p>Submit xerox copies of your credit cards (no debit cards) and account statements for the previous six months or</p>
  		</item>
  		<item>
  			<p>Statements of your bank account(s) for the previous six months, with a confirmation by the bank or</p>
  		</item>
  		<item>
  			<p>c. if you know a friend or have a family in Europe, then you can ask them to get you a Formal Obligation (or Verpflichtungserklärung in German). You have to know the person as they have to go to the city hall to get this paper for you and then they have to send the original copy to you which you will submit in the embassy. I did this for my application.</p>
  		</item>
  		<item>
  			<p>Do I still need proof of income if the one who invites me will shoulder all my expenses during my stay in their country? No. The Formal Obligation covers this.</p>
  		</item>
  		<item>
  			<p>How much money should I have in my bank? You must have at least 45 euros per day for your trip if you’re applying through the German Embassy. Other embassies have different monetary requirement.</p>
  		</item>
  		<item>
  			<p>Proof that you will not run away and stay illegally in Europe:</p>
  			<list>
  				<item>
  					<p>If you are employed: income tax return, certificate of employment (including name, complete address and telephone number of your employer with area code, details regarding your position or professional designation, income, duration of the working relationship, approved leave of absence signed by the employer) OR</p>
  				</item>
  				<item>
  					<p>If you are a student: School certificate (for pupils), University certificate: proof of enrollment (for students), if applicable a written exemption from studies by school or university.</p>
  				</item>
  				<item>
  					<p>If you are unemployed and would go back to work right after your trip, you can also show your Job Offer if you have one. Save you sanity and make sure you submit any of these documents that prove that you will come back to the Philippines. The people working in embassies are paranoid androids and they would deny you outright if you don’t submit a complete application. Heck, they wouldn’t even accept your application if its incomplete in the German embassy. Just please make sure you have all these documents before applying. Don’t even try if you are missing one. Don’t give them any chance to shatter your dreams!</p>
  				</item>
  			</list>
  		<item>
  			<p>What should I wear to the interview? Most people probably don’t think of this but you should consider how you look when you go to the embassy for your interview. Please wear decent clothes and look respectable. Wear shoes and not slippers! For sure the interviewer is already judging you by how you look. So don’t give him/her the chance to think you’re someone who will stay illegally in Europe…[snip]. Look your best. Look your most fabulous.</p>
  		</item
  		<item>
  			<p>How is the interview like? The interviewer can ask you any question about your trip and your documents so be ready to answer him/her. Just relax and smile and say “Good morning!” when you get to the window. Don’t show her your nervous because you shouldn’t be. You’re great. You’re amazing and you want to go to Europe for a nice vacation. You’re not planning to stay illegally in Europe to mop floors – in the dark! – for a living, right? Right. So relax.</p>
  		</item>
  		<item>
  			<p>After the interview, they will ask for the visa application fee and your passport and give you a receipt.</p>
  		</item>
  		<item>
  			<p>Are the interviewers really scary? Not really. They’re just humans who have a boring, repetitive job of interviewing people to check if you’re planning to stay illegally in Europe. So if you will talk to one who looks bored and can’t be bothered, just smile and be polite and answer the questions confidently.</p>
  		</item>
  		<item>
  			<p>What if I get denied? What can I do next? If you’re denied, you can file an appeal. The embassy is required by law to give you a valid reason for denying you and they are also required by law to give you an advice regarding the legal remedy on what you should do to get approved. But there’s no guarantee that you will get approved. They will check your application again including your appeal papers and this can take at least one month.</p>
  		</item>
  		<item>
  			<p>For those getting this rejection reason: your intention to leave the territory of member states before expiry of the visa could not be ascertained, you should send more proof that you are going back to the Philippines like a job or a job offer or proof of your own business.</p>
